# Timed-Code-Quiz
Module 4 challenge - A timed coding quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
## Instructions
The acceptance criteria for this challenge was to create a timed quiz that included a process that when you click the start button a timer would begin and then a questions would be displayed. Also, when you select a incorrect answer time will be subrtracted from the game clock. When the game is over you can save your score and intials.
### Results
I have created a quiz that when you hit the start button a timer of 75 seconds will begin in the upper right corner and then the questions will begin. The user will be alerted when they select a correct or incorrect answer with a message of "correct" and "wrong!". When the user selects a incorrect answer the timer will deduct by 10 seconds. Once the quiz is over the user will be able to save their intials with their score and the quiz will be reset. Highscores will be stored and they will be able to see past highscores.
